## Comments

Two types of comments are defined: single and multi-line. Single line comments
begin with the semicolon (`;`) character, and end with a newline. Multi-line
comments begin with `#|` and end with `#|`. Multi-line comments can be nested
arbitrarily.

## Banned Characters

A tab character (`U+0009`) in source text is a syntax error.
