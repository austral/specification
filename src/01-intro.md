# Introduction

Austral is a low-level, statically-typed, memory safe, compiled dialect of Lisp.

## The Language

### Design Principles

### Anti-Features

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Specially in syntax definitions, the following rules are used:

1. Text in angular brackets represents a variable, eg. <var>, <args>, <val>.

2. The following quantifiers, when found after an expression, represent that the
   expression:

    `+`
    : Appears at least once.

    `*`
    : Appears any number of times.

    `?`
    : Is optional.

3. Curly brackets are used to group expressions.
4. Square brackets denote optional expressions.
