# Module System

Modules are the unit of code organization in Austral. Modules have two parts:
the module interface file and the module body file.

## Module Interfaces

The interface contains declarations that are importable by other modules, as
well as an optional private section of declarations (for example, functions)
that are available within the module but not importable.

An interface file can have the following declarations:

- Constant declarations.
- Type declarations (opaque or public).
- Function declarations.
- Type class declarations.
- Type class instance declarations.

Examples:

Given the following interface file:

```
interface Example is
    -- The constant C is importable, but the interface
    -- doesn't know its value.
    constant C : Float32

    -- Modules that import R can access the fields
    -- x and y directly.
    record R is
        x: Int32,
        y: Int32
    end

    -- Modules can refer to the type T, but don't know
    -- how it's implemented.
    type T

    -- Modules that import U know that it's a renaming
    -- of Int32, and can construct U instances accordingly.
    type U = Int32

    -- Functions can only be declared, not defined, in
    -- interface files.
    function Fact(n: Nat32): Nat32;

    -- Type classes must be defined with the full set of
    -- methods.
    typeclass Class(t: Type) is
        method Foo(t: Type): t
    end

    -- Instances are simply declared.
    instance Class(Int32) is
        method Foo(t: Int32): Int32
    end
end.
```

The following is a module definition that satisfies the interface:

```
module Example is
    constant C : Float32 := 3.14;

    -- Record R doesn't have to be redefined here.
    -- Type T, however, has to be defined. In this case
    -- it's a record.
    record T is
        hidden: Bool;
    end

    -- Function bodies must appear in the module body.
    function Fact(n: Nat32): Nat32 is
        if n = 0 then
            return 1;
        else
            return n * Fact(n-1);
        end if
    end

    -- Type class instances must be defined here:
    instance Class(Int32) is
        method Foo(t: Int32): Int32 is
            return t;
        end
    end
end.
```
